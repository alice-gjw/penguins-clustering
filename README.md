## `penguins.ipynb` initial findings

Positive correlations:
- Culmen length & Flipper length (0.66)
  - Penguins with larger beaks have longer flippers. 
- Culmen length & Body mass (0.59)
  - Larger penguins have longer beaks.
- Flipper length & Body mass (0.87)*
  - Larger penguins have longer flippers.

Stronger Negative correlation:
- Culmen depth & Flipper length (-0.58)
  - Deeper beaks = Shorter flippers. 
- Culmen depth & Body mass (-0.47)
  - Deeper beaks = Lower body mass.
